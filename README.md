# Project-Computational-Neuroscience
This repository is about project of computational neuroscience 

## 1.Problem statement
  SUA processing on the data recorded from the V1 region of the monkey by providing a microelectrode and producing a spike train and calculating the firing rate and some important parameters

## 2.Related works
  explores existing research and solutions related to your project

## 3.Proposed Method


## 4.Implementation

### 4.1. Dataset
Multi-electrode recordings of ongoing activity and responses to parametric stimuli in macaque V1. Contributed by Chou Hung lab, Georgetown University.
(https://crcns.org/data-sets/vc/pvc-5).
### 4.2. Model
In this subsection, explain your model that you're goning to fit your dataset

### 4.3. Evaluate
filtering/calculate the firing rate,F.F,inter spike interval(ISI),auto correlation function and coefficiant of variation(CV)
